This is a plugin for tumbler (the thumbnaililing system used by Thunar and Marlin), that allows
it to produce thumbnails for FreeCAD's .fcstd files.

.fcstd files behave exactly like .odf files (from openoffice/libreoffice), they are actually
a .zip file containing a .png thumbnail image (thumbnails/Thumbnail.png). This plugin is copied/adapted the odf plugin

The .so plugin must be copied manually in your tumbler plugins dir (usr/lib/x86xxx/tumbler-1/plugins) after
being built, since I still couldn't make install targets in the CMake file work...
