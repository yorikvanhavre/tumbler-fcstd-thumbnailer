This is a plugin for tumbler (the thumbnaililing system used by Thunar and Marlin), that allows
it to produce thumbnails for FreeCAD's .fcstd files.

.fcstd files behave exactly like .odf files (from openoffice/libreoffice), they are actually
a .zip file containing a .png thumbnail image (thumbnails/Thumbnail.png)

This plugin must be copied manually in your tumbler plugins dir (usr/lib/x86xxx/tumbler-1/plugins) after
being built, since I still haven't setup install targets in the CMake file.

WARNING - The plugin still doesn't work, I don't know why... (Copied/adapted the odf plugin, which works fine)
